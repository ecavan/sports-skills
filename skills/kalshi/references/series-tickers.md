**IMPORTANT:** On Kalshi, "Football" = American Football (NFL). Soccer is under "Soccer".

| Sport | Series Ticker | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| NBA | `KXNBA` | Games + futures |
| NFL | `KXNFL` | Games + futures |
| MLB | `KXMLB` | Games + futures |
| Champions League | `KXUCL` | Futures (winner) |
| La Liga | `KXLALIGA` | Futures (winner) |
| Bundesliga | `KXBUNDESLIGA` | Futures (winner) |
| Serie A | `KXSERIEA` | Futures (winner) |
| Ligue 1 | `KXLIGUE1` | Futures (winner) |
| FA Cup | `KXFACUP` | Futures |
| Europa League | `KXUEL` | Futures |
| Conference League | `KXUECL` | Futures |

Not all soccer leagues have futures/winner markets. EPL has match-day games but **no title winner** market. Use `get_sports_filters()` to discover all available competitions.
