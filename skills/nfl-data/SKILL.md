# NFL Data

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails (package not found or Python version error), install from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/machina-sports/sports-skills.git
```
The package requires Python 3.10+. If your default Python is older, use a specific version:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills nfl get_scoreboard
sports-skills nfl get_standings --season=2025
sports-skills nfl get_teams
```

Python SDK (alternative):
```python
from sports_skills import nfl

scores = nfl.get_scoreboard({})
standings = nfl.get_standings({"params": {"season": "2025"}})
```

## Choosing the Season

Derive the current year from the system prompt's date (e.g., `currentDate: 2026-02-16` → current year is 2026).

- **If the user specifies a season**, use it as-is.
- **If the user says "current", "this season", or doesn't specify**: The NFL season runs September–February. If the current month is March–August, use `season = current_year` (upcoming season). If September–February, the active season started in the previous calendar year if you're in Jan/Feb, otherwise current year.
- **Never hardcode a season.** Always derive it from the system date.

## Examples

**User: "What are today's NFL scores?"**
```bash
sports-skills nfl get_scoreboard
```

**User: "Show me the AFC standings"**
```bash
sports-skills nfl get_standings --season=2025
```
Then filter results for AFC conference.

**User: "Who's on the Chiefs roster?"**
```bash
sports-skills nfl get_team_roster --team_id=12
```

**User: "How did the Super Bowl go?"**
1. Find the event_id from `get_scoreboard --week=23` (Super Bowl = week 23)
2. Call `get_game_summary --event_id=<id>` for full box score
Alternatively, use `get_schedule --week=23` to find the event.

## Error Handling

When a command fails, **do not surface raw errors to the user**. Instead:
1. Catch silently and try alternatives
2. If team name given instead of ID, use `get_teams` to find the ID first
3. Only report failure with a clean message after exhausting alternatives

## Troubleshooting

- **`sports-skills` command not found**: Run `pip install sports-skills`. If the package is not found on PyPI, install from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/machina-sports/sports-skills.git`
- **Team not found**: Use `get_teams` to list all teams and find the correct ID
- **No data for future games**: ESPN only returns data for completed or in-progress games
- **Week numbers**: Regular season is weeks 1-18. Postseason uses unified numbering: Wild Card=19, Divisional=20, Conference Championship=21, Pro Bowl=22, Super Bowl=23. The connector translates these to ESPN's internal `seasontype=3` automatically.
- **Team schedule includes postseason**: `get_team_schedule` returns both regular-season and postseason games.
