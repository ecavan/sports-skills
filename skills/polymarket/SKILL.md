description: |
  Polymarket prediction markets — live odds, prices, order books, events, series, market search, leaderboards, portfolio analytics, trading, and on-chain operations. Core commands require no auth or CLI install. Advanced commands require the polymarket CLI binary.

  Use when: user asks about sports betting odds, prediction markets, win probabilities, market sentiment, "who is favored to win" questions, Polymarket leaderboard, portfolio positions, or wants to trade on Polymarket.
  Don't use when: user asks about actual match results, scores, or statistics — use football-data or fastf1 instead. Don't use for historical match data. Don't use for news — use sports-news instead. Don't confuse with Kalshi — Polymarket focuses on crypto-native prediction markets with deeper sports coverage; Kalshi is a US-regulated exchange with different market structure.

# Polymarket — Sports Prediction Markets

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills polymarket get_sports_markets --limit=20
sports-skills polymarket search_markets --query="NBA Finals"
```

Python SDK (alternative):
```python
from sports_skills import polymarket

markets = polymarket.get_sports_markets(limit=20)
prices = polymarket.get_market_prices(token_id="abc123")
```

## Prerequisites

**Core commands** (11 commands) work out of the box — no dependencies, no API keys.

**CLI commands** (30+ commands) require the Polymarket CLI binary:
```bash
brew tap Polymarket/polymarket-cli https://github.com/Polymarket/polymarket-cli
brew install polymarket
```

**Trading commands** additionally require a configured wallet:
```bash
polymarket wallet create
polymarket approve set
```

If a CLI command returns "polymarket CLI not installed", install the binary above.

## Important Notes

- **Prices are probabilities.** A price of 0.65 means 65% implied probability. No conversion needed.
- **`token_id` vs `market_id`:** Price and orderbook endpoints require the CLOB `token_id`, not the Gamma `market_id`. Always call `get_market_details` first to get `clobTokenIds`.
- **`search_markets` matches event titles**, not sport categories. Use specific league names ("Premier League", "Champions League"), not generic terms ("soccer", "football").
- **`cli_search_markets`** is a more powerful full-text search via the CLI binary. Use it when `search_markets` returns no results.
- Before complex fetches, run the parameter validator: `bash scripts/validate_params.sh <command> [args]`

## Examples

User: "Who's favored to win the NBA Finals?"
1. Call `search_markets(query="NBA Finals", sports_market_types="moneyline")`
2. Get `token_id` from the market details
3. Call `get_market_prices(token_id="...")` for current odds
4. Present teams with implied probabilities (price = probability)

User: "Who will win the Premier League?"
1. Call `search_markets(query="English Premier League")` -- use full league name
2. Sort results by Yes outcome price descending
3. Present teams with implied probabilities (price = probability)

User: "Show me Champions League odds"
1. Call `search_markets(query="Champions League")`
2. Present top contenders with prices, volume, and liquidity

User: "Show me the Polymarket leaderboard"
1. Call `get_leaderboard(period="week", order_by="pnl", limit=20)`
2. Present traders with rank, username, PnL, and volume

User: "What positions does this wallet hold?"
1. Call `get_positions(address="0x...")`
2. Present positions with outcome, size, avg price, current value, PnL

User: "Buy 10 shares of YES on this market"
1. Call `get_market_details(market_id="...")` to get `token_id`
2. Call `create_order(token_id="...", side="buy", price="0.55", size="10")`
3. Call `get_orders()` to confirm

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

- If search returns 0 results, try full league names ("English Premier League" not "EPL", "Champions League" not "CL"). search_markets matches event titles.
- If `get_market_prices` fails, you likely used `market_id` instead of `token_id`. Always call `get_market_details` first to get CLOB `token_id`.
- If prices seem stale, check `get_last_trade_price` for the most recent trade. Low-liquidity markets may have wide spreads.
- If a CLI command returns "polymarket CLI not installed", the command requires the Rust binary. The original 11 commands work without the CLI.
- If a trading command fails with an auth error, ensure a wallet is configured: `polymarket wallet create && polymarket approve set`.
- **Never fabricate odds or probabilities.** If no market exists, state so.
