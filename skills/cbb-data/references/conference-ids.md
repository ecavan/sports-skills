# CBB Conference IDs

Use the `--group` parameter for standings and scoreboard filtering.

| Conference | Group ID | Conference | Group ID |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| ACC | 2 | Big 12 | 8 |
| SEC | 23 | Big Ten | 7 |
| Big East | 4 | Pac-12 | 21 |
| American | 62 | Mountain West | 44 |
| Atlantic 10 | 3 | West Coast | 26 |
| Missouri Valley | 18 | Colonial | 10 |

**Tip:** Conference IDs are different from CFB. Use `get_standings` without a group to see all conferences.
