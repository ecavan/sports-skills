## What This Is

A collection of agent skills that wrap **publicly available** sports data sources and APIs. These skills don't provide proprietary data — they give AI agents a structured interface to data that's already freely accessible on the web:

- **Football**: ESPN, Understat, FPL, Transfermarkt — 21 commands across 13 leagues
- **NFL**: ESPN — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, leaders, news
- **NBA**: ESPN — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, leaders, news
- **WNBA**: ESPN — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, leaders, news
- **NHL**: ESPN — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, leaders, news
- **MLB**: ESPN — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, leaders, news
- **Golf**: ESPN — PGA Tour, LPGA, DP World Tour leaderboards, schedules, player profiles, news
- **Formula 1**: FastF1 open-source library — sessions, lap data, race results
- **Prediction Markets**: Kalshi and Polymarket public APIs — markets, prices, order books
- **Sports News**: RSS feeds and Google News — any public feed

Each skill is a SKILL.md file that any compatible AI agent can load and use immediately. Data comes from third-party public sources and is subject to their respective terms of use.

> **Personal use only.** These open-source skills rely on third-party public APIs and are intended for personal, non-commercial use. For commercial or production workloads with licensed data, SLAs, and enterprise support, see [machina.gg](https://machina.gg).
